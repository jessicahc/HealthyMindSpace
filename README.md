The app aims to connect users with licensed social workers and chat rooms based on their moods and feelings such as depression, eating disorders, or significant life events. The app includes features such as mental health prevention around the user's neighborhood/city and a chat room for users to connect with others who have similar feelings or moods. 

The app collects data through keyword analysis of the community chat and uses that data to inform hospitals and politicians about the data impacting their community. Hospitals can then build programs based on the appâ€™s data. 

The ultimate goal is to prevent mental health crises decrease suicides and inform hospitals and politicians about the mental health issues affecting their community.
